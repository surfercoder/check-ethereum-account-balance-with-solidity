# check-ethereum-account-balance-with-solidity

We are going to create a new smart contract with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and it is going to include just a variable to host our selected address, a setter method to change it and a read only method to ask for its balance using the solidity `.balance` property from `address` data type. For this small project we are going to use the awesome online [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) IDE so you can write your solidity code there, compile your smart contract and deploy it to test it altogether in the same place!
